    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sometimes it's fun just to see what you can make using Jell-O! Is this dish a winner? Well, you're going to have to try it for yourself to find out! </p>
        <p>We made this giant Jell-O ring using everyone's childhood favorite - Spaghetti-Os! The flavor is exactly as you remember, only it's cold instead of piping hot. Serve it with some Vienna sausages, hot dogs and sliced bread for a unique twist on an American classic. Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ cup condensed tomato soup</li>
            <li>2 (¼ ounce) packets unflavored gelatin</li>
            <li>2 cans Spaghetti-Os</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, pour in your water and condensed tomato soup, then sprinkle the gelatin on top. Allow gelatin to bloom in the water, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once gelatin has bloomed, stir together lightly.</li>
            <li>Place the pot on the stove and turn the heat to medium, then keep stirring occasionally until the gelatin has completely dissolved, and the mixture is quite smooth.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and add the Spaghetti-Os to the pot. Mix until well-combined, then pour evenly into 4 cup ring mold.</li>
            <li>Refrigerat mold for 4 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, loosen mold by placing in a bowl of warm water, then invert onto a plate. Serve with vienna sausages.</li>
        </ol>
